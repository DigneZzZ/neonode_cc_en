# Marzban Managed SaaS: Your VPN Business Without the Tech Hassle

We’re excited to launch **Marzban Managed SaaS**, a service that makes deploying and managing Marzban panels easier than ever. Want a VPN business without the headaches? We’ve got the tech covered so you can focus on making money.

## What Do We Offer?

- **Full Management:** We install, configure, and update your Marzban panel on our infrastructure. Transfer your existing panel or start fresh.
- **Stability and Security:** Reliable servers for fast and secure performance.
- **Backups:** Your working directory and database are backed up every 3 hours.

All you need to do is connect your overseas nodes. We provide a script for quick deployment. No mess, just a working service.

## Who Is This For?

- Those building a **serious VPN business**, not just messing around with tests.
- Those who value **stability** and are willing to pay for quality.
- Those who want to delegate the tech stuff to pros.

## Who Is This Not For?

- People who think a VPN can run on a rusty laptop or a USB stick.
- DIY enthusiasts who "can set it up themselves" and then spend days cursing DNS and firewalls.
- Bargain hunters with a 200-ruble VPS that dies under load.
- Casual testers who just want to "try it out" with no plan to profit.
- Cheap shared hosting fans who don’t mind crashes when the server’s overloaded.

We’re here for business, not experiments. If you want dirt-cheap hosting, look elsewhere — this is corporate-grade quality.

## Additional Services

- **SHM Panel:** A subscription-selling bot to monetize your VPN effortlessly.
- **Boxed Solution:** A turnkey business with a website, VPN, and Telegram mini-app.
- **Server Rentals:** High-end hardware with 5 Gbps network for your needs (not for RU nodes).
- **Specific Services:** Matrix Federation for communication and SFTPgo for secure file sharing.

## Pricing

Pricing scales with your project — from user count to extra services. We’ve updated our rates to ensure your business runs smoothly without glitches. Check the full details in our channel: [https://t.me/marzban_msaas/15](https://t.me/marzban_msaas/15).
