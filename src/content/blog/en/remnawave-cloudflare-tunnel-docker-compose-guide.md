## How to Set Up a Cloudflare Tunnel for Remnawave VPN Panel with Docker Compose?

You can deploy the Remnawave VPN panel and its subscription page using Docker Compose behind a secure Cloudflare Tunnel. This approach eliminates the need for port forwarding, nginx configuration, or manual HTTPS setup ‚Äî making it ideal for production or home environments without a public IP.

---

## What is Remnawave Panel?

[Remnawave Panel](https://remna.st) is a modern VPN and proxy management system based on XRay, built with a focus on flexibility, automation, and Telegram bot support. It includes:

* A convenient admin panel
* A Telegram bot for notifications
* Active and stable development
* Clean architecture with PostgreSQL as the database
* OpenAPI 3.0 and universal integrations
* Independent nodes (unlike Marzban)
* A beautifully designed subscription page

---

## Benefits of Using Cloudflare Tunnel for Docker VPN Panels

* Don‚Äôt have a public IP? No problem.
* No need for port forwarding in your router or firewall.
* Cloudflare provides HTTPS, WAF, DDoS and bot protection.
* Everything runs in containers ‚Äî no need to configure nginx, certbot, etc.

Cloudflare Tunnel lets you securely expose your local **VPN management panel**, subscription pages, or any other Docker-based web service. This is especially useful when deploying a **self-hosted VPN** without a public IP or when you want to protect your server behind **Cloudflare‚Äôs WAF and HTTPS** layer.

On the downside, CF Tunnel uses automatic proxying which may be **restricted or blocked** in some regions like Russia.

---

## Running a VPN Panel Without Port Forwarding

We‚Äôll configure Cloudflare Tunnel access to:

* **Remnawave panel** (`remnawave:3000`) ‚Üí `https://panel.example.com`
* **Subscription page** (`remnawave-subscription-page:3010`) ‚Üí `https://sub.example.com`

---

## Step 1. Create the Tunnel

Install `cloudflared` on your server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/static/downloads/cloudflared-install.sh | bash
```

Authorize and create the tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared login
cloudflared tunnel create remnawave-tunnel
```

Copy the JSON file from `~/.cloudflared/remnawave-tunnel.json` into your project directory (e.g., `./cloudflared/`).

---

## Step 2. Configure DNS

Create DNS routes for your subdomains:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns remnawave-tunnel panel.example.com
cloudflared tunnel route dns remnawave-tunnel sub.example.com
```

---

## Step 3. Project Structure

```yaml
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cloudflared/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ remnawave-tunnel.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml
```

---

## Step 4. `config.yml` ‚Äî Tunnel Configuration

```yaml
tunnel: remnawave-tunnel
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/remnawave-tunnel.json

ingress:
  - hostname: panel.example.com
    service: http://remnawave:3000
  - hostname: sub.example.com
    service: http://remnawave-subscription-page:3010
  - service: http_status:404
```

---

## Step 5. `docker-compose.yml`

We‚Äôll use the `docker-compose.yml` file from the official repository, adding the subscription page service:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  remnawave-db:
    image: postgres:17
    container_name: remnawave-db
    hostname: remnawave-db
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
      - TZ=UTC
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:6767:5432'
    volumes:
      - remnawave-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - remnawave-network
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', 'pg_isready -U $${POSTGRES_USER} -d $${POSTGRES_DB}']
      interval: 3s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  remnawave:
    image: remnawave/backend:latest
    container_name: remnawave
    hostname: remnawave
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:3000:3000'
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - remnawave-network
    depends_on:
      remnawave-db:
        condition: service_healthy
      remnawave-redis:
        condition: service_healthy

  remnawave-subscription-page:
    image: remnawave/subscription-page:latest
    container_name: remnawave-subscription-page
    hostname: remnawave-subscription-page
    restart: always
    environment:
      - REMNAWAVE_PLAIN_DOMAIN=panel.com
      - SUBSCRIPTION_PAGE_PORT=3010
      - META_TITLE="Subscription Page Title"
      - META_DESCRIPTION="Subscription Page Description"
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:3010:3010'
    networks:
      - remnawave-network

  remnawave-redis:
    image: valkey/valkey:8.0.2-alpine
    container_name: remnawave-redis
    hostname: remnawave-redis
    restart: always
    networks:
      - remnawave-network
    volumes:
      - remnawave-redis-data:/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'valkey-cli', 'ping']
      interval: 3s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: cloudflared
    restart: always
    command: tunnel --config /etc/cloudflared/config.yml run
    volumes:
      - ./cloudflared:/etc/cloudflared
    networks:
      - remnawave-network

networks:
  remnawave-network:
    name: remnawave-network
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  remnawave-db-data:
    driver: local
    name: remnawave-db-data
  remnawave-redis-data:
    driver: local
    name: remnawave-redis-data
```

## Full Docker Setup with Cloudflare Tunnel

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check:

* `https://panel.example.com` ‚Äî should open the panel
* `https://sub.example.com` ‚Äî should open the subscription page

I intentionally left out the full Remnawave setup to focus on **using CF Tunnel**.

## üîê Securing the Remnawave Panel with Cloudflare Access

If you want to add an extra layer of authentication to your Remnawave panel or subscription page ‚Äî without using nginx or custom login systems ‚Äî you can use **Cloudflare Access**, part of Cloudflare Zero Trust.

### What Cloudflare Access offers:

* Restrict access to authorized users (Google, GitHub, email, etc.)
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
* Access policies by email, IP, group, country, and more
* Audit logs and login tracking
* Filters requests **before** they reach your server

---

### How to Enable Authentication with Cloudflare Access

1. **Go to the Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard**:
   [https://one.cloudflare.com](https://one.cloudflare.com)

2. Navigate to **Access > Applications** and click **+ Add an application**.

3. Choose application type: **Self-hosted**.

4. Fill in the following fields:

   * **Application Name**: `Remnawave Panel`
   * **Subdomain**: `panel.example.com`
   * **Session duration**: e.g., 8 hours

5. Create an access policy:

   * **Rule name**: `Allow company users`
   * **Include** ‚Üí Emails ending with `@example.com` *(or any filter you prefer)*

6. Save and activate the application.

Now, any request to `https://panel.example.com` will first be validated by Cloudflare Access ‚Äî only authenticated users will reach your tunnel and Docker container.

---

üí° **Note**: To use Cloudflare Access, your domain must be using **Cloudflare Nameservers** and be active in your Cloudflare dashboard.
